# Airline Reservation System

This project was generated with [Java], isn't that cool!

## Testing

This software product will be tested using Mockito and JUnit 5.
Maven has been proposed to help integrate the software with the program to avoid having to include a bunch of libraries each time. :)

## Running Locally

we run this using Eclipse IDE. MySQL Server needs to be running with a schema named "airline". After schema has been created run SQL commands located in SWT-AirlineProduct/Database.
